## Lessons Learned

I did spend significant time on improving styling of website and making sure it looks similar to provided designs. Pure CSS is used so the next task will be to make styles more reusable.
For Example -
There are many instances where the following properties were used

```
{
    display:flex;
    align-items:center;
    justify-content:space-between;
}
```

to improve we can crete a class which will have these properties and then apply it where we need.
